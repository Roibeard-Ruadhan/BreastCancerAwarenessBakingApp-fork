[Stay A Breast](http://stay-a-breast.herokuapp.com/index)

## Introduction

Stay A Breast is a website for breast cancer awareness aimed at bringing people together over breast cancer and baking. Stay A Breast will provide a platform for users to share recipes with other users, and promote baking with others, hopefully while discussing breast cancer. The site will also provide information on breast cancer prevention and detection, giving users something to talk to their fellow bakers about, including information on how to perform self checks, and where to go for further information.

Users will be able to register for the website, login and share recipes for fellow bakers, supported by MongoDB.

## Deployment

This website was created in the Gitpod development environment. After creating a new repository in GitHub using the Code Institute template, the green Gitpod button was used to initialise the repository in Gitpod. Throughout the process the git commands git add and git commit were used to store the work in the local Gitpod environment, git push would then be used to push the commits to the GitHub repository. From here the website could then deployed via Heroku.
Heroku Deployment

Before creating the application in Heroku,

    Create a requirements.txt file in your work environment by running the following command in the command line interface:

    pip3 freeze â€”local > requirements.txt

This will save all the dependencies currently used by the app to the requirements.txt file.

    Create a Procfile, which tells Heroku which file runs the app and how to run it. To do this run the following command in the CLI:

    echo web: python app.py > Procfile

    Git add, git commit and git push these files to GitHub so they are available to Heroku which will use them to build the app.

In Heroku

    Login and click New -> Create New App
        Add a name
        Select region
        Click Create App

    Select Connect to GitHub, when the Github profile is displayed add the name of your repo and click search, once it finds & displays the correct repo click connect.

    Set up the config vars required to run the app. In the Settings Tab click Revel Config Vars

    Create the following variables and assign their values: IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME
    Click Hide Config Vars

    In the Deploy Tab
        Click Enable Automatic Deploys
        Select the branch the repo is using
        Click Deploy Branch => Your app was successfully deployed will be displayed with the option to view the app.

Creating A Local Clone

You can clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer.

From the Git Hub repository:

    Click Code at the top of the file list
    Click the clipboard icon to copy the url provided

Open terminal:

    Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be
    Type git clone and paste the copied url after it
    Press enter and the clone will be created
