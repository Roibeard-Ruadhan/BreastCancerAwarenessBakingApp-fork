<h4>What is Cancer?</h4>
<p>
    Cancer is a broad term for a class of diseases characterized by abnormal cells that grow and invade  healthy cells in the body.  Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast as a group of cancer cells that can then invade surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body.
</p>

<h4>What Causes Cancer to Develop</h4>
<p>
    Cancer begins in the cells which are the basic building blocks that make up tissue. Tissue is found in the breast 
    and other parts of the body.  Sometimes, the process of cell growth goes wrong and new cells form when the body doesn’t need them and old or damaged cells do not die as they should.  When this occurs, a build up of cells often forms a mass of tissue called a lump, growth, or tumor. 
</p>
<p>
    Breast cancer occurs when malignant tumors develop in the breast.  These cells can spread by breaking away from the original tumor and entering blood vessels or lymph vessels, which branch into tissues throughout the body. When cancer cells travel to other parts of the body and begin damaging other tissues and organs, the process is called metastasis.
</p>

<h4>Known Risk Factors</h4>
<p>
    Women with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop breast cancer. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors (such as drinking alcohol) can be avoided. But most risk factors (such as having a family history of breast cancer) can’t be avoided. Having a risk factor does not mean that a woman will get breast cancer. Many women who have risk factors never develop breast cancer.

<h3 id="signs-and-symptoms" class="awareness-bg">Signs and Symptoms</h3>

<h4>What Are the Symptoms and Signs of Breast Cancer?</h4>
<p>
    Every person should know the symptoms and signs of breast cancer, and any time an abnormality is discovered, it should be investigated by a healthcare professional.    

    Most people who have breast cancer symptoms and signs will initially notice only one or two, and the presence of these symptoms and signs do not automatically mean that you have breast cancer.

    By performing monthly breast self-exams, you will be able to more easily identify any changes in your breast.  Be sure to talk to your healthcare professional if you notice anything unusual.
</p>

<h4>A Change In The Breast Or Nipple Appearance</h4>
    <ul class="signSymptomsList">
        <li>Any unexplained change in the size or shape of the breast.</li>
        <li>Dimpling anywhere on the breast.</li>
        <li>Unexplained swelling of the breast (especially if on one side only).</li>
        <li>Unexplained shrinkage of the breast (especially if on one side only).</li>
        <li>Recent asymmetry (unequal or lack of sameness) of the breasts. Although it is common for women to have one breast that is slightly larger than the other, if the onset of asymmetry is recent, it should be checked.</li>
        <li>Nipple that is turned slightly inward or inverted.</li>
        <li>Skin of the breast, areola, or nipple that becomes scaly, red, or swollen or may have ridges or pitting resembling the skin of an orange.</li>
    </ul>


<h4>Any Nipple Discharge — Particularly Clear Discharge Or Bloody Discharge</h4>
<ul class="signSymptomsList">
    <li>
    It is also important to note that a milky discharge that is present when a woman is not breastfeeding 
    should be checked by her doctor, although it is not linked with breast cancer. Let your doctor know about any 
    nipple discharge, clear, bloody or milky. The most concerning discharges are bloody or clear.    
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="diagnosis" class="awareness-bg">Diagnosis</h3>
<p class="awarenessNotices">
    Breast cancer can be diagnosed through multiple tests, including a mammogram, ultrasound, MRI and biopsy.
</p>
<h4>Mammogram</h4>
<p>
    A mammogram is an x-ray of the breast. While screening mammograms are routinely administered to detect breast cancer in women who have no apparent symptoms, diagnostic mammograms are used after suspicious results on a screening mammogram or after some signs of breast cancer alert the physician to check the tissue. A diagnostic mammogram can help determine if these symptoms are indicative of the presence of cancer. As compared to screening mammograms, diagnostic mammograms provide a more detailed x-ray of the breast using specialized techniques. They are also used in special circumstances, such as for patients with breast implants. 
</p>
<h4>Ultrasound</h4>
<p>
    When a suspicious site is detected in your breast through a breast self-exam or on a screening mammogram, your doctor may request an ultrasound of the breast tissue. A breast ultrasound is a scan that uses penetrating sound waves that do not affect or damage the tissue and cannot be heard by humans. The breast tissue deflects these waves causing echoes, which a computer uses to paint a picture of what’s going on inside the breast tissue (no radiation is involved). A mass filled with liquid shows up differently than a solid mass. 
</p>
<h4>MRI</h4>
<p>
    During diagnostic examinations, it is helpful to get a variety of images and perspectives. If your initial exams are not conclusive, your doctor may recommend a breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to assess the extent of the disease.

    During a breast MRI, a magnet connected to a computer transmits magnetic energy and radio waves (not radiation) through the breast tissue. It scans the tissue, making detailed pictures of areas within the breast. These images help the medical team distinguish between normal and diseased tissue. 
</p>
<h4>Biopsy</h4>
<p>
    A breast biopsy is a test that removes tissue or sometimes fluid from the suspicious area. The removed cells are examined under a microscope and further tested to check for the presence of breast cancer. A biopsy is the only diagnostic procedure that can definitely determine if the suspicious area is cancerous.

    The good news is that 80% of women who have a breast biopsy do not have breast cancer.

<h3 id="treatment" class="awareness-bg">Treatment</h3>
<p>
    In general, there are five treatment options, and most treatment plans include a combination of the following: surgery, radiation, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies. Some are local, targeting just the area around the tumor. Others are systemic, targeting your whole body with cancer fighting agents.

<h3 id="breastexam" class="awareness-bg">How to Perform a Breast Self-Exam</h3>
<p class="awarenessNotices">
    Adult women of all ages are encouraged to perform breast self-exams at least once a month.
</p>
<h4>In the Shower</h4>
<p>
    With the pads/flats of your 3 middle fingers, check the entire breast and armpit area pressing down with light, medium, and firm pressure. Check both breasts each month feeling for any lump, thickening, hardened knot, or any other breast changes.
</p>
<h4>In Front of a Mirror</h4>
<p>
    Visually inspect your breasts with your arms at your sides. Next, raise your arms high overhead.

    Look for any changes in the contour, any swelling, or dimpling of the skin, or changes in the nipples. Next, rest your palms on your hips and press firmly to flex your chest muscles. Left and right breasts will not exactly match—few women’s breasts do, so look for any dimpling, puckering, or changes, particularly on one side.
</p>
<h4>Lying Down</h4>
<p>
    When lying down, the breast tissue spreads out evenly along the chest wall. Place a pillow under your right shoulder and your right arm behind your head. Using your left hand, move the pads of your fingers around your right breast gently covering the entire breast area and armpit.

    Use light, medium, and firm pressure. Squeeze the nipple; check for discharge and lumps. Repeat these steps for your left breast.
